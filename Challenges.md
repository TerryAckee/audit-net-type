This is an audit subnet filter that identifies private networks and takes away the risk of human error by automating the process of calculating subnets for you!
The first time experience of becoming a network specialist in coding has been a struggle, understanding all the new terms is tiring! As it is in any new 
program langauge learning experience! It is hard remembering little details. Deciding which details to value and remember gets difficult as well.
I learned the types of networks that are stored in different values of the subnet mask system [- Corporate, University, Home Office, small Scale Businesses-]!
